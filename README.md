Reviewing academic papers
===========================

If you work in academia you will be asked to referee papers. Your first review will almost
certainly be something you are asked to do by your advisor. But as your career goes on and
you become recognized as an expert in one (or many!) areas, you will have the ahem...opportunity
to review a lot more. 

No one ever gave me formal guidelines for writing reviews. I think this experience is pretty similar to 
most graduate students. The format, tone, and content of these documents is usually learned via an
apprenticeship model (if at all). 

This document serves to describe the way that you will write reviews while a member of the Leek group. 
The goal is to avoid becoming [reviewer number three](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VRBWLpYCPY) while 
simultaneously fulfilling your role to the academic community. It is a responsibility that must be
taken seriously, but almost everyone wishes other people did better.
