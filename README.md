Reviewing academic papers
-------------------------

If you work in academia you will be asked to referee papers. Your first review will almost
certainly be something you are asked to do by your advisor. But as your career goes on and
you become recognized as an expert in one (or many!) areas, you will have the ahem...opportunity
to review a lot more. 

No one ever gave me formal guidelines for writing reviews. I think this experience is pretty similar to 
most graduate students. The format, tone, and content of these documents is usually learned via an
apprenticeship model (if at all). 

This document serves to describe the way that you will write reviews while a member of the Leek group. 
The goal is to avoid becoming [reviewer number three](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VRBWLpYCPY) while 
simultaneously fulfilling your role to the academic community. It is a responsibility that must be
taken seriously, but almost everyone wishes other people did better. 


What is peer review?
-------------------------

A scientific paper can be distilled into four parts: 

1. A set of methodologies
2. A description of data
3. A set of results
4. A set of claims 

When you (or anyone else) writes a paper the goal is to communicate clearly items 1-3 so that they
cna justify the set of claims they are making. 

In the current peer review system there are currently three tasks you are responsible for as a peer
reviewer:

1. Evaluating the quality and accuracy of the methods, data, and results.
2. Determining whether the methods, data and results justify the claims.
3. Determining how important the claims are and whether they belong in the journal the paper was submitted to.

I'll discuss how you should think about each of these goals below but an important point to keep in mind
is that it will be very difficult to know for sure about any of these claims. In order of frequency
the types of papers you will get to review are: papers where 1-2 are 


Format of a review
-------------------------

When you write a review it should have the following components:

* A summary of the paper (motivation, methods, results) written in your own words of about a paragraph. 
* (optional) A bulleted list of overarching issues
* A list of major issues
* A list of minor issues

Here are some things that your review should not contain:

* A recommendation of whether to accept or reject the paper
* Requests for citations to a bunch of your papers (this will matter more later in your career)
* Requests for experiments/simulations that are unnecessary to justify the main points in the paper
* Insulting criticism or sarcasm

Remember that this is a professional document. They are typically anonymous (you don't have to sign your name)
but the associate editor and editor will see the review and your reputation will be affected by the quality
of the work you perform.
