Reviewing academic papers
===========================

If you work in academia you will be asked to referee papers. Your first review will almost
certainly be something you are asked to do by your advisor. But as your career goes on and
you become recognized as an expert in one (or many!) areas, you will have the ahem...opportunity
to review a lot more.
