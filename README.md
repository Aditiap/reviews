Reviewing academic papers
-------------------------

If you work in academia you will be asked to referee papers. Your first review will almost
certainly be something you are asked to do by your advisor. But as your career goes on and
you become recognized as an expert in one (or many!) areas, you will have the ahem...opportunity
to review a lot more. 

No one ever gave me formal guidelines for writing reviews. I think this experience is pretty similar to 
most graduate students. The format, tone, and content of these documents is usually learned via an
apprenticeship model (if at all). 

This document serves to describe the way that you will write reviews while a member of the Leek group. 
The goal is to avoid becoming [reviewer number three](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VRBWLpYCPY) while 
simultaneously fulfilling your role to the academic community. It is a responsibility that must be
taken seriously, but almost everyone wishes other people did better. 


What is peer review?
-------------------------

A scientific paper can be distilled into four parts: 

1. A set of methodologies
2. A description of data
3. A set of results
4. A set of claims 

When you (or anyone else) writes a paper the goal is to communicate clearly items 1-3 so that they
cna justify the set of claims they are making. 

In the current peer review system there are currently three tasks you are responsible for as a peer
reviewer:

1. Evaluating the quality and accuracy of the methods, data, and results.
2. Determining whether the methods, data and results justify the claims.
3. Determining how important the claims are and whether they belong in the journal the paper was submitted to.

Ideally you would be able to verify every single claim in the paper and test every result. Given the time 
constraints of the review process and the remuneration you get for reviewing, this is absolutely not 
feasible. Your goal is instead to do your best to obtain reasonable estimators of each of the three
components of the review and "show your work" by providing references, pointing to figures, and putting
results in context. 


Format of a review
-------------------------

When you write a review it should have the following components:

* A summary of the paper (motivation, methods, results) written in your own words of about a paragraph. 
* A list of major issues
* A list of minor issues
* A list of typos you find

I think the summary is critical because if you can't distill the ideas down then you haven't really understood
the paper. The summary should absolutely _not_ be a restatement of the abstract of the paper, you should
find the parts you think are most relevant and include them in the summary. 

The major issues should be a bulleted list. Depending on the quality of the paper this list may be longer
or shorter. A major issue has to be one of the following: (1) a claim that is not supported by the data, 
(2) a method or result that appears completely incorrect, (3) a critical missing piece of information,
or (4) a paper that is not readable by a person trying their best to understand it. 

Not making all data and code available with a specific link and instructions, is a major issue. 

Minor issues should also be a bulleted list. There are a much broader range of minor issues that you
may encounter. Some examples include simulations that miss some cases, figures that are missing axis labels,
or 



Here are some things that your review should not contain:

* A recommendation of whether to accept or reject the paper
* Requests for citations to a bunch of your papers (this will matter more later in your career)
* Requests for experiments/simulations that are unnecessary to justify the main points in the paper
* Insulting criticism or sarcasm

Remember that this is a professional document. They are typically anonymous (you don't have to sign your name)
but the associate editor and editor will see the review and your reputation will be affected by the quality
of the work you perform.
